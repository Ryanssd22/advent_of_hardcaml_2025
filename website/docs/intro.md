# What is Advent of Hardcaml

**Advent of Hardcaml** is a programming challenge which combines two rather difficult programming challenges:

1. Advent of Code
2. Hardcaml

This challenge is hosted by [Jane Street](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/), a quant firm. And knowing these "quanters", I'm expecting this challenge to be new and esoteric to me.

## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/) is a yearly series of puzzles set during the season of Advent.

There are typically 25 puzzles for each year, but for 2025, there are only 12.

## Hardcaml

[Hardcaml](https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml) is a library for OCaml that facilitates the creation and simulation of hardware designs.

Jane Street is known to invest heavily in the OCaml and Hardcaml workflow, and they're even the ones who maintain Hardcaml.
Thankfully, they have one of their guys actively participating in this challenge as well, so there'll be a lot of learning from his repository.

## My Grindset

Since I don't have much planned over this Christmas break, and I want to make sure my brain doesn't rot,
my plan is to learn of all these things in a month.

Realistic? Not sure.

Using this website, I'll try to document what I've researched.
Hopefully, by the end of this challenge, you too could learn a thing or two about hardware design.
